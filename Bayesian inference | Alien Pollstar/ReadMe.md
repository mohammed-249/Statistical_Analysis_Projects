# Project Overview

This project explores the application of **Bayesian inference** to estimate the proportion of voters supporting a particular candidate in an election. It simulates a scenario where an alien pollster crash-lands in the US on the eve of the 2016 presidential election and attempts to gauge support for Hillary Clinton using limited data and Bayesian updating.

# Key Skills Demonstrated

**Bayesian inference:** Applying Bayes' theorem to update beliefs based on new evidence.

**Prior and posterior distributions:** Working with prior beliefs and posterior distributions to model uncertainty.

**Confidence intervals:** Constructing and interpreting confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty.

**Statistical analysis and interpretation:** Conducting statistical analysis and interpreting results in the context of the problem.

# Approach

- **Hypothesis formulation:** Defining a set of possible hypotheses about the proportion of voter support.
- **Prior specification:** Assigning prior probabilities to each hypothesis, initially using a uniform prior.
- **Data collection:** Simulating the collection of poll data from a sample of voters.
- **Likelihood calculation:** Computing the likelihood of the observed data under each hypothesis.
- **Posterior calculation:** Updating prior beliefs to posterior beliefs using Bayes' theorem.
- **Posterior summarization:** Calculating summary statistics (e.g., mode, median, mean) of the posterior distribution.
- **Confidence interval estimation:** Constructing a 95% confidence interval to quantify uncertainty.
- **Iterative updating:** Repeating the polling and updating process to explore how beliefs evolve with more data.
- **Prior sensitivity analysis:** Examining the impact of different prior distributions on the results.
# Results and Interpretation

Posterior distribution: The project demonstrates how the posterior distribution reflects updated uncertainty about the true proportion of voter support.

Confidence interval: The 95% confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true proportion.

Prior impact: The project highlights how the choice of prior can influence the posterior distribution and confidence interval.

Iterative updating: The simulations show how beliefs evolve as more data is collected.
