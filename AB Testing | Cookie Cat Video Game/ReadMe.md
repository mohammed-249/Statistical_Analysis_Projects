# AB Testing | Cookie Cat Video Game

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Cookie Cats A/B Testing Project! In this analysis, I utilized statistical methods to investigate the impact of relocating the first gate in the Cookie Cats video game from level 30 to level 40 on player retention. The dataset, comprising 90,000 players, allowed for a thorough exploration of day-1 and day-7 retention rates.

## Approach

- **A/B Testing:** Employed rigorous A/B testing methodology to compare player retention under different gate placement conditions.

- **Data Analysis:** Utilized Python for comprehensive data analysis, focusing on the calculation and comparison of day-1 and day-7 retention rates.

- **Bootstrapping:** Applied bootstrapping techniques to assess the uncertainty in retention numbers, providing a robust understanding of statistical significance.

- **Critical Insights:** Engaged in critical thinking to interpret unexpected results, revealing intriguing patterns in player behavior.

## Results

The analysis uncovered nuanced insights into player retention. Surprisingly, moving the gate to **level 40** resulted in **lower day-1 retention rates**, challenging conventional expectations. **Bootstrapping** revealed a **1-2%** difference in most samples, with a **96%** probability that the samples had a difference of more than 0%. Additionally, **day-7 retention rates** were consistently higher when the gate was at level 30. The unexpected findings suggest a potential connection to the theory of hedonic adaptation, wherein strategically placed gates prolong player enjoyment.
