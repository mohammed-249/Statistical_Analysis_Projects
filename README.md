# Overview

Welcome to my Statistical Analysis Projects repository! Here, I showcase my proficiency in statistical analysis, covering a diverse range of topics such as Bayesian inference, Frequentism, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and more. This repository serves as a portfolio of my data science skills, particularly in the realm of statistical analysis.

# Projects
**Project 1:**  [**Beyesian Inference | Genome Compression Task**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Statistical_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Bayesian%20inference%20%7C%20Genome%20Compression%20Task)

*Utilizing Bayesian approach and Variable-Length Codes for DNA compression. Optimal binary mapping achieves efficient storage, demonstrating statistical analysis and information theory in genomics.*
  
**Project 2:**  [**Beyesian Inference | Human vs Machine Task**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Statistical_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Beyesian%20Inference%20%7C%20Human%20vs%20Machine%20Task)

*Bayesian Set Analysis distinguishes human-generated from computer-generated binary sequences using Bayesian inference, revealing posterior probabilities through data-driven modeling for effective pattern recognition.*

**Project 3:**  [**AB Testing | Cookie Cat Video Game**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Statistical_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/AB%20Testing%20%7C%20Cookie%20Cat%20Video%20Game)

*Exploring player retention with gate placement. Unexpected findings challenge norms, hinting at hedonic adaptation's role in user engagement.*

**Project 4:**  [**Beyesian inference | Alien Pollster**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Statistical_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Beyesian%20inference%20%7C%20Alien%20Pollstar)

*In this project I used Bayesian inference to estimate local election support for a specific candidate, simulating an alien pollster's investigation with limited data and evolving beliefs.*
