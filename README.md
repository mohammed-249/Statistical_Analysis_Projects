# Overview

Welcome to my Statistical Analysis Projects repository! Here, I showcase my proficiency in statistical analysis, covering a diverse range of topics such as Bayesian inference, Frequentism, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and more. This repository serves as a portfolio of my data science skills, particularly in the realm of statistical analysis.

# Projects
**Project 1:**  [**Beyesian Inference | Genome Compression Task**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Statistical_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Bayesian%20inference%20%7C%20Genome%20Compression%20Task)

  *Exploring player retention with gate placement. Unexpected findings challenge norms, hinting at hedonic adaptation's role in user engagement.*

**Project 2:**  [**Beyesian Inference | Human vs Machine Task**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Statistical_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Beyesian%20Inference%20%7C%20Human%20vs%20Machine%20Task)

**Project 2:**  [**AB Testing | Cookie Cat Video Game**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Statistical_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/AB%20Testing%20%7C%20Cookie%20Cat%20Video%20Game)
