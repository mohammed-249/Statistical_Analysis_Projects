# Overview

Welcome to my Statistical Analysis Projects repository! Here, I showcase my proficiency in statistical analysis, covering a diverse range of topics such as Bayesian inference, Frequentism, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and more. This repository serves as a portfolio of my data science skills, particularly in the realm of statistical analysis.

# Projects
Project 1: Bayesian Inference

Project 2: Frequentism

Project 3: A/B Testing

Project 4: Hypothesis Testing

Project 5: More Projects
