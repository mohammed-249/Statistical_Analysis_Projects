# Beyesian Inference | Human vs Machine Task

## Project Description

This project utilizes a Bayesian approach to distinguish between computer-generated and human-generated binary sequences. The binary sequences are represented by two sets, `set1` and `set2`. The Bayesian analysis calculates the posterior probability for each set, shedding light on the likelihood of each set being human or computer-generated.

## Bayesian Approach

The Bayesian approach involves modeling the posterior probability of a hypothesis given observed data. In this case, the hypothesis is whether a set of binary sequences is human-generated or computer-generated. The analysis considers prior beliefs, likelihood of the observed data under each hypothesis, and normalizes to compute the posterior probability.

## Results

The analysis generates plots illustrating the prior and posterior probabilities for each set. These plots help visualize the model's confidence in distinguishing between the two types of sequences. The posterior probabilities can be interpreted as the updated belief in the hypothesis given the observed data.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `bayesian_set_analysis.ipynb`.

2. Execute the notebook cells to perform Bayesian analysis on `set1` and `set2`.

3. View the generated plots to understand the prior and posterior probabilities.
